'Hello world' project that uses polymer code generation.

Can be build by using either maven or ant:

* For Maven - maven v. 3.0.5 or later is recommended.
* For Ant - in this case ant will still rely on the local maven repository, assuming it contains all the required artifacts).
The easiest way to do a maven build is to build polymer project by using maven before trying to build ant project.
